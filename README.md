### About

Your goal is to make it as far as possible, jumping and ducking over various obstacles. The game is loosely based on the google chrome dinosaur jumping game that plays when your internet dies. The player is constantly moving forward and has to dodge incoming obstacles


### Running Jump Rush Locally

If you are using a Mac, run "host.command". Else, if you are running a Windows machine, run "host.bat". These start the server on which the game runs. Afterwards, open Google Chrome, and go to "localhost:8000". The game should appear on the "localhost:8000" tab. Have fun!
